#Hello To Anyone Who Reads This,

  This is my attempt at understanding JavaScript at a lower level by recreating functions and
  methods from scratch with very little help from the actual language functions. If you're on the
  journey to be a JavaScript master come join me and add to this thing with some cool projects.

    I will continue to add to this so people can challenge themselves and see a solution, out
    of the thousands of solutions there are.

    I hope this finds you well.

    #Love, ya boi!
